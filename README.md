# Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping
**Announcements**

Welcome to the Further Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Poly-Wide Elective.

**Module Aims**

This elective is a continuation of the Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals module. In Digital Fabrication & Prototyping Fundamentals, students are introduced to basic digital fabrication skills such as CAD, 3D printing, laser cutting and the arduino. 

In this elective, students continue on their digital fabrication journey, learning additional skills such as CNC machining, designing and fabricating custom circuit boards, applications programming and the Internet of Things. Students develop and enhance their knowledge of these skills through a range of weekly hands-on assignments and a final capstone project.

**Teaching Methods**

The module incorporates active and experiential learning *(CDIO Standard 8)* through a combination of tutorials, e-learning and practical workshop sessions. To help the students better understand the basic essential concepts, demonstrations will also be conducted in the lab/workshop *(CDIO Standard 6)*. Audio visual media, hardware and various teaching aids will be used in the course delivery for effective learning. 

Students have to demonstrate their ability to work individually and in groups to encourage teamwork, personal and interpersonal communication skills. 

**Methods of Assessment**

Assessment will be based on exercises and projects through three in-course assessments (ICA) as follows:

|S/No |Item |Description |Weightage |
|-----|-----|------------|----------|
| 1	|CA1 |Documentation/Website	|20% |
| 2	|CA2 |Fablab (Digital Fabrication) Skills	|40% |
| 3	|CA3 |Summative Project	|40% |
