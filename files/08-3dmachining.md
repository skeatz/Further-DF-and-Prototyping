## assignment
- group assignment:
  - review the safety data sheets for each of your molding and casting materials
  - then make and compare test casts with each of them
- individual assignment:
  - design a mold around the stock and tooling that you'll be using,
  - mill it (rough cut + (at least) three-axis finish cut),
  - and use it to cast parts
