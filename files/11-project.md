## Final Project
- This is an individual capstone project that integrates the range of technologies covered in this module.
- Your project must meet the following requirements:
  - The final project must include:
    - 2D and/or 3D designed part(s)
    - subtractive manufacturing (i.e. cnc) part
    - may include:
      - molded or cast part(s)
      - 3d printed part(s)
      - laser cut part(s)
    - an embedded microntroller that you designed & fabricated
    - input and/or output device(s) that interacts with the user
    - embedded program
  - Your project must include
    - all original design & source code files
    - screen capture/photos showing stages in development as well as final product
  - System integration/packaging is an important aspect of a final project. All electronics should be neatly mounted and wiring neatly laid out and not simply just thrown together in the case   

## Group Project
- You may combine with other students to do a larger, more challenging project
- Each member's portion of the group project must meet the individual project requirements listed above
- You must document the role/task of each member if it is a group project
- Each member of the group must document the overall project on your individual website, with emphasis on your individual contribution to the group project
    
## Project presentation
- Prepare a 1 page (1920 x 1080 pix) poster of your project, showing
  - overall project
  - technologies used
  - if group project, list of group members
- Prepare a 1 minute video (1920 x 1080) documenting your project development process and final version of the project

## Other project information
- Complete your final project, tracking your progress:
  - what tasks have been completed, and what tasks remain? 
  - what's working? what's not?
  - what questions need to be resolved?
  - what will happen when?
  - what have you learned?
- Bill of materials
- Technologies used, fabricated or purchased

## Reminder on Time Management
* Project management
  * triage
  * documentation during development
  * demand- vs supply-side time management
  * spiral development, DevOps
  * serial vs parallel tasks
  * system integration
  * finish quality
* **Document as you work**, do not wait to complete everything before you start your documentation
